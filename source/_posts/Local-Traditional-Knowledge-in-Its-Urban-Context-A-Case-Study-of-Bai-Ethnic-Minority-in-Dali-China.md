## Abstract

As China experiences rapid urbanization, local traditional knowledge (LTK) has been increasingly brought to the public’s attention as a significant feature of cultural identity and inclusiveness. Especially in ethnic minority areas, it is important to respect LTK so that the cultural identity and social cohesion of ethnic minorities can be sustained in an increasingly urbanized environment. The objective of this research is to explore the incorporation of LTK during the process of urbanizing China’s ethnic minority regions from the perspective of residents. Using Dali City as a case study, this book investigates local Bai people’s perspective on LTK with urbanization in mind. 
Multiple methods are employed to examine the impact of LTK on Dali’s cultural landscape. Based on questionnaires answered by eighty Bai people, this research finds that the city has a well-preserved Bai cultural landscape. Complementary to the questionnaire findings, the focus group analysis and daily field observations lead to a conclusion that local Bai people perceive cultural preservation as necessary for their future. Respondents placed a high cultural value on the Bai language, traditional architecture, and traditional festivals. Nonetheless, a discrepancy is evident between participants’ preference for cultural preservation and their actual commitment, which reveals that preservation is facing challenges, especially among the younger generations.
By demonstrating that there are profound differences in Bai LTK conservation between the urban and rural areas, this study contributes to more realistic descriptions of the impact of urbanization in Dali. Particularly, it captures the cultural processes which transform the built environment and reveals that a further step is required to integrate LTK with urban development. The decision-making process for ethnic cultural preservation is highly complicated and refers to achieving a benefit equilibrium for every stakeholder using a more participative approach. LTK has an intrinsic value for a liveable city and is instrumental in inclusive urbanism. The research findings assert a better understanding of cultural preservation from the perspective of Bai people in Dali and shed light on the interplay between LTK and sustainable development in the ethnic minority region.
